The Odin Project- Landing Page

Having taken freeCodeCamp's online curriculum, and taken David Grey's Youtube tutorials, I have built landing pages for those sights. This is the landing page for the Oding Project.   I suspect it will be easier for me to build, as the previous lessons have been easier than my previous experiences with the other curriculums. I will be  building a landing page for Idaho Pinball Museum. They currently have a Wordpress website that I will gather information from.
